# GamblingGameSimulation
This project was made for the operations research course at the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello (UCAB)

## Description
The program runs a simulation of a series of bets that you can made, where you can insert the amount of the initial bet, your initial wallet amount, your winning money target, and how many simulations you want to play. If your money goes to zero, you lose. You have two type of simulations in the program:

1. Every time you win a bet, the next one you bet the initial bet amount, but if you lose, the next bet you have to bet double.
2. Every time you lose a bet, the next one you bet the initial bet amount, but if you win, the next bet you have to bet double.


## How to run the Program?
1. Clone the project
2. Install in your computer pandas by running the comand `pip install pandas`
3. Install in your computer openpyxl by running the comand `pip install openpyxl`
4. Run the `main.py` file
